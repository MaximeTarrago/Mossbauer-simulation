yes		! Electronic structure informations at the end of the file ('yes') or not (anything else)
2		! Number of electronic configurations
2 2 1 2 0	! orbital population (dxy, dxz, dyz, dz2, dx2-y2)
2 1 2 2 0	
0.0		! excitation Energies of the excited el. states (in cm-1) with respect to the lowest (corresponding to the first written configuration above)

fast		! electronic relaxation limit. Only fast limit is implemented for now.
normal		! grid systems: 'leb' (Lebedev quadrature, very fast but not recommended for high-field spectra because of frequent intruder peaks due to the approximate powder-averaging), 'normal' or 'fine'
